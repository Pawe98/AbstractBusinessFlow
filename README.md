# AbstractBusinessFlow

     The objective of the ApplicationFunction is to encapsulate the entirety of a function's logic,
     including both its internal operations and the Yes/No/Always progression triggers. This makes a clear separation
     between what the function does on its own and how it behaves when the BusinessFlow controls it.
     By defining a clear boundary, this setup mitigates ambiguity in determining whether logic should reside within the
     ApplicationFunction or the BusinessFlow. The distinction streamlines the codebase, offering clarity on where the
     logic is housed and how it's conditionally invoked.
